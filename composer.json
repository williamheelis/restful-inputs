  "description": "Simple RESTful globals: $_PUT, $_PATCH, $_DELETE, $_HEADER, $_JSON, $_PATH, $_RES for PHP APIs. Basically this is an extension of the logic PHP probably intended when they introduced _GET and _POST and this package simply extends it and is useful shorthand option for RESTful api end points as a result. The focus was on inline brevity, and assumes plenty of `/api/someItem/index.php` -> `PATCH::/api/someItem/` structure. (i.e lots of dirs with one index.php each!)",
